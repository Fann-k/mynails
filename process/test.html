		Hello world, this is a website about something i need to do for gd2
	i can't wait to finish this assignment and go on summer break! 
	This is how to write <span style="color:red;">inline</span><sup>CSS</sup>
	Chris says inline is the worst because it takes too long? internal is supposed to be best. or external with links and stuff.
